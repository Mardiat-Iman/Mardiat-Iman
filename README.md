# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mardiat!
I love learning new things and putting my skills to the test. I’ve had a few internships in different roles, but I’m now diving into Data Science and AI (if you’re looking for an intern, hit me up!). I’ve also started exploring hackathons—still getting the hang of it, but it’s been fun so far (2 down, more to go!). Always up for collaborating on random projects.
